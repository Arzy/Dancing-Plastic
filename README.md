Dancing Plastic
===========

####Introduction :

Dancing Plastic is a Sobeit's fork (https://github.com/BlastHackNet/mod_s0beit_sa). The goal of this project is to give to anyone an easy-to-use and an user friendly addon for SA-MP. The main goal is not to make new cheats.

####New/Modified feature :
* Modified the keybind system. This is now different. It used to be only one sentence per key. But now, you can say more than one sentence per key !

Check this example in the .ini :

>chat[] = 1 "~Hello mates !~How are you ?~~"

This line means that when you will press the key "1", you will see that :

>[14:13:10] your_name: hello mates !

>[14:13:10] your_name: how are you ?

So, you have to put sentence between ~, and at the end, put ~~.

As you can see, I removed the spam feature, since I don't really like it. I will surely add new feature to the keybind.
