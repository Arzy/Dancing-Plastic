Dancing Plastic
===========

Dancing Plastic is a Sobeit's fork (https://github.com/BlastHackNet/mod_s0beit_sa). The goal of this project is to give to anyone an easy-to-use and an user friendly addon for SA-MP. The main goal is not to make new cheats.

I will write here what I have added.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question.
