Dancing Plastic
===========

####Introduction :

Dancing Plastic is a Sobeit's fork (https://github.com/BlastHackNet/mod_s0beit_sa). The goal of this project is to give to anyone an easy-to-use and an user friendly addon for SA-MP. The main goal is not to make new cheats.

####New/Modified feature :
* Modified the keybind system. This is now different. It used to be only one sentence per key. But now, you can say more than one sentence per key !

Check this example in the .ini :

>chat[] = 1 "~Hello mates !~How are you ?~~"

This line means that when you will press the key "1", you will see that :

![alt tag](http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/427423samp001Copie.png)

So, you have to put sentences between ~, and at the end, put ~~.

As you can see, I removed the spam feature, since I don't really like it. I will surely add new feature to the keybind.

* You can now see your favorite SA-MP servers that you have added with your SAMP-client. The only thing that you have to do is to copy your USERDATA.DAT file into your mod_sa/ directory.

USERDATA.DAT can be found in your gta userfile.
